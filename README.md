## Contributing

Contributions consistent with the goals and anti-goals of the package are welcome.

Please make an issue ticket to discuss changes before investing significant time into a branch.

Goals

* Library-level functions and formulas
* Comprehensive documentation including literature references, assumptions, and units-of-measure
* Quantitative unit-testing of formulas
* Performance (both speed and memory-efficiency)
    * Eliminate the need for databases to store the results of the computation
* Cross-platform compatibility
* Minimization of long-term maintenance overhead (both for the library, and for users of the library)
    * Semantic versioning
    * Automated linting and formatting tools
    * Centralized CI and toolchain configuration in as few files as possible

Anti-Goals

* Fanciness that increases environment complexity, obfuscates reasoning, or introduces platform restrictions
* Brittle CI or toolchain processes that drive increased maintenance overhead
* Application-level functionality (graphical interfaces, simulation frameworks, etc)
