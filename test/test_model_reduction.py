    In general,
    dx/dt = Ax + Bu
        y = Cx + Du
    x is current vector I
    u is voltage vector V
    
    For this particular case, with `V - RI = MdI/dt`,
    the state-space reformulation is
    
    dx/dt = dI/dt = -M^-1 @ R @ I + M^-1 @ V
        y =     I = eye @ x + 0 @ u
    
    So
    `A = -M^-1 @ R`
    `B = M^-1`
    `C = eye`
    `D = 0`
    
    We don't need C and D here, because we're not going to use this
    in an actual state space formalization. In fact, the `control`
    library isn't able to simulate even 100us of the full system
    due to the presence of some extremely small timescales.
    
    We also can't easily compare to the `control` library's balred
    (balanced reduction) method here, because the coils have near zero resistance,
    so the system is _almost_ unstable under a constant input, which causes slycot
    (the fortran backend for `control.balred`) balanced reduction to
    sort-of-fail (keeps >200 modes).
    
    Instead, we can check the initial rate of change of coil current under a step in coil voltage
    between the full system and the transformed system."""
