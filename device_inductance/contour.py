    Specialized contour-tracing algo for finding the last closed flux contour
    defining the edge of a tokamak plasma.
    Among other uses, this contour is needed in order to estimate the plasma's
    self-inductance.

    Attempts to trace a closed contour starting at `start` and returns None
    if the contour crosses the limiter or does not make a full loop, or if
    the resulting contour ends up being excessively long (longer than the limiter).

    Args:
        grids: [m] 1D coordinate grids for computational domain
        psi_total: [T-m^2] 2D grid of total poloidal flux
        start: [m] Initial guess coordinates
        maxis: [m] Magnetic axis coords from O-point search
        limiter_circumference: [m] Limiter length in R-Z plane, to bound expected contour length
        mask_limiter: Float mask of limiter interior (1.0 inside, 0.0 outside)
        ds: [m] Step size. Defaults to 1e-2.
        tol: [T-m^2] Contour flux level tolerance. Defaults to 1e-4.

    Returns:
        Optional[(rpath, zpath)] contour path coordinates if a closed loop was found
